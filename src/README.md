Yousef's Personal Website
=========================

This repo serves as the free hosting area for [my website](https://yhakbar.com).
It is deployed using *Github Pages*

It is designed to be a static page.
No JS is used.
Just HTML and CSS.

Current Pages
-------------

The current pages available in html:

 - index (homepage)
 - library (collection of books read)
 
SASS
----

I use `SASS` converted to CSS to style my pages.
This provides programming flexibility and less hassled
styling format.

Suggestions
-----------

I am open to suggestions for design choices and/or additions.
